# 🎮 Unity Challenge 4 – Ball Movement

This Unity mini-project is part of the Unity Beginner Challenges. In **Challenge 4**, we implement a simple system where a **ball moves around** in response to player input.

---

## 🧠 Challenge Description

The goal of this challenge is to move a ball around the scene using physics-based movement. This helps you practice:

- Rigidbody physics
- Input handling
- Basic game object control

---

## 🎥 Features

- A 3D ball that moves based on player input (WASD or arrow keys)
- Rigidbody-based motion for smooth, physics-driven control
- A simple flat ground plane to roll the ball on

## 🎮 Controls

| Key   | Action        |
| ----- | ------------- |
| W / ↑ | Move Forward  |
| S / ↓ | Move Backward |
| A / ← | Move Left     |
| D / → | Move Right    |
